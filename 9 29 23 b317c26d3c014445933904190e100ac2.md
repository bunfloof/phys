## Lecture 9/29/23

1) Physics is evidence based ⇒ must measure, quantify 

significant figures, implicit statement about precision of knowledge.

Notice:
units
displacement (distance): meters (m) 

time: seconds (s) 

mass: kilogram (kg)

Example:

A ball moves 2m in 7 seconds. What is its speed?

$$
\frac{2m}{7s}=0.2857142857
$$

If I change the last 7 to an 8, then in 7 seconds, the ball would move 2.0000000006 m.

Implicit in the given “2” and “7” is a precision.

Guideline for reporting the number of significant figures: quote the same number of figures as the least precise input values.

so $\frac{2m}{7s}$ = 0.29 m/s or 0.3 m/s

2) Scientific notation

 “100 thousand million”:
  

$$
100 * 10^3 * 10^6 = 100 * 10^{(3+6)} = 100 * 10^9 = 1.00 * 10^{11}
$$

“orders of magnitude”: $10^6=10*10*10*10*10*10=1000000$

operations:

$$
3.0 * 10^3 + 9.0 * 10= \\

$$

3) dimensional analysis:

- an excellent way to spot errors.
- see Discussion section for techniques

4) vectors

some physical quantities have magnitude and direction

move an object 5 m to the right from position 1 to 2.

velocity is a vector, whose magnitude is called “speed”

quantities whilst direction “there are 270 students here” called a scaler.

- vectors have magnitude and direction.
    
    if change either, you change the vector.
    
- if you rotate or move a vector, its length stays the same.
- vectors have algebra: add, subtract, multiply

Notations:

$$
\vec{A} \text{ or bold-face in books}
$$

In cartesian coordinates:

$$
\vec{A} = A_x\hat i+ A_y \hat j + A_z \hat k
$$

$$
\begin{matrix}

\begin{matrix}

\vec{A} &= \\ &

\end  {matrix}

&\begin{matrix}
&A_x&\hat i &+ &A_y &\hat j &+ &A_z &\hat k \\
&&\downarrow & &&\downarrow & &&\downarrow \\

\end  {matrix}
\\ & \text{unit vectors}
\end  {matrix}
$$

$$
A_x, A_y, A_z \text{ components}
$$

Length of vector (Magnitude)

$$
|\vec A | = \sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2+A_z^2}
$$
