# Problem Set 1

**Problem 3:** When dividing two numbers in scientific notation, the coefficients are divided, and the exponents are differenced. This is the formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{a\times10^s}{b\times10^t}&=\frac{a}{b}\times10^{s-t}
\\
&=c\times10^q \quad \text{where} \quad 
\begin{cases} 
1 \le c < 10 \\
q \in (..., -2, -1. 0, 1, 2, ...)
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

If the quotient $\frac{a}{b}$ does not have a single non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point, then a factor of $10^m$ must be introduced to move the decimal place with a corresponding factor modifying the exponential factor. Apply this procedure to obtain the quotient, in the correct format, of the numbers below:

$$
\frac
{\textcolor{red}{2.47}\times10^{\textcolor{red}{-3}}}{\textcolor{red}{77.8}}
$$

**Part (a)** In order to format the result in correct scientific notation, the decimal of the quotient must be shifted.

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac
{\textcolor{red}{2.47}\times10^{\textcolor{red}{-3}}}{\textcolor{red}{77.8}}=c\times10^q\quad \text{where} \quad 
\begin{cases} 
1 \le c < 10 \\
q \in (..., -2, -1. 0, 1, 2, ...)
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

Enter the number of places, m, by which the decimal must be shifted.

$$
\frac{2.47}{77.8}\times{10^{-3}}
\\
0.03174807197943445\times 10^{-3}
\\
\boxed{m=2}
$$

After shifting the decimal points 2 places to the right, we get approximately 3.175. Each time we shift the decimal point one place to the right, we are multiplying by 10.

Tip: 

- Moving the decimal once (to make 0.3175) is multiplying by $10^1$.
- Moving the decimal a second time (to make 3.175) is multiplying by $10^2$

**Part (b)** Using the correct value of m from the previous step, which procedure will result with the quotient in correct scientific notation?

A. The quotient 2.47/77.8 automatically has a single non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point.
B. Multiply the quotient 2.47/77.8 by 10^m while also multiplying the exponential factor by 10^m.
**C. Multiply the quotient 2.47/77.8 by 10^m while dividing the exponential factor by 10^m.**
D. Divide the quotient 2.47/77.8 by 10^m while multiplying the exponential factor by 10^m.
E. Divide the quotient 2.47/77.8 by 10^m while also dividing the exponential factor by 10^m.

**Part (c & d)** With the quotient written in proper scientific notation, enter the value of the coefficient c and the value of the exponent q.

$$
\boxed{c=3.175}
$$

Since we multiplied our coefficient by $10^2$, we need to subtract that power from the exponent by 2.

$$
10^{-3} \\
10^{-3-2} \\
10^{-5} \\
\boxed{q=-5}
$$

Tip:

- **If you multiply the coefficient by a power of 10**: You **subtract** that power from the exponent.
- **If you divide the coefficient by a power of 10**: You **add** that power to the exponent.

Putting it all together:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac
{\textcolor{red}{2.47}\times10^{\textcolor{red}{-3}}}{\textcolor{red}{77.8}}&=c\times10^q
\\&=
\boxed{3.175\times10^{-5}}
\end{align*}
$$

**Problem 4:**   Answer the following question concerning velocity and speed.

If a particle has constant speed, is its velocity necessarily constant? **no**

Imagine you're a wolf, running around in a big, open field. 🐺

**Scenario 1**: You're running in a straight line, keeping the same pace. Your speed is constant (because you're not running faster or slower), and your velocity is also constant because you're not changing direction.

**Scenario 2**: Imagine you're running in a big circle, like you're chasing your tail. You're keeping the same pace, so your speed is constant. But, even though you're running at the same speed, you're always changing the direction in which you're running. This means your velocity is changing because velocity cares about both how fast you're going and which way you're going.

So, just because you have a constant speed (like in Scenario 2), it doesn't mean your velocity is constant. Your velocity changes if you change direction, even if you keep running at the same speed. In short: If you run straight without speeding up or slowing down, both your speed and velocity are constant. But if you change direction while running, even if you don't change your speed, your velocity changes.

**Problem 5:**   Answer the following question concerning velocity and speed.

If a particle has constant velocity, is its speed necessarily constant? ******yes******

**Scenario**: This time, you decide to run in a perfectly straight line without changing your pace (speed) or direction. That means you have a constant velocity, because both your speed and direction are unchanging.

Now, here's the key point: If you have a constant velocity, it means both your direction and speed are not changing.

So, to answer the question: If a particle (or a wolf) has constant velocity, then yes, its speed is necessarily constant.

**Problem 6:**   Consider two vectors, $A = A_x i + A_y j$ and $B = B_x i + B_y j$.

**Part (a)** If **A = B**, then does $A_x = B_x$ and $A_y = B_y$?

A. No, never.
B. Sometimes.
**C. Yes, always.**

**Part (b)**  If |**A**| = |**B**|, then does $A_x = B_x$ and $A_y = B_y$?

A. No, never.
**B. Sometimes.**
C. Yes, always.

Tip:

In the context of vectors, |A| and |B| does not refer to absolute values. Instead, it refers to the **magnitude** of the vector. The **magnitude** of a vector is the length, size, or “distance” the vector covers. When we say |A| = |B|, we’re saying that the lengths of vector A and B are the same.

**Problem 7:**   Consider two vectors:

$$
\vec{A}=a_1\hat i+a_2\hat j \\
\vec{B} = b_1\hat j + b_2\hat j
$$

**Part (a)**  Enter an expression for the magnitude of vector $\vec{A}$, denoted as $A = |\vec{A}|$.

$$
\boxed{A=\sqrt{a^2_1+a^2_2}}
$$

**Part (b)**  Enter an expression for the magnitude of vector $\vec{B}$, denoted as $B = |\vec{B}|$.

$$
\boxed{B=\sqrt{b^2_1+b^2_2}}
$$
